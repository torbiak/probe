INTRODUCTION                                                     *probe-intro*

A pure-VimL fuzzy finder inspired by kien's ctrlp.vim and wincent's Command-T.


INSTALLATION                                              *probe-installation*

1. Install Tim Pope's pathogen plugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
2. Clone or download to $HOME/.vim/bundle:

    $ git clone https://github.com/torbiak/probe.git ~/.vim/bundle/probe


USAGE                                                            *probe-usage*

probe caches the filepaths under Vim's current working directory and offers an
incremental search of that cache. When the number of matching filepaths is
small enough they are ordered by a simple ranking algorithm that favours
characters matching immediately after a path separator or another matched
character, or at the beginning or end of a filepath. Because of this ranking
algorithm the best approach to finding files using probe is to enter the first
few characters of some path components as you work your way towards your
target.

Subsequence search mode:

    If the query doesn't contain any spaces, probe finds filepaths containing
    the query as a subsequence. Thus, "ulmwhat" is a reasonable query to
    search for /usr/local/man/whatis.

Substring search mode:

    If the query contains spaces, filepaths containing each space-delimited
    substring are matched. Thus, 'loc man what' is also a very specific query
    for /usr/local/man/whatis.

Subsequence mode typically results in good results in fewer keystrokes, but
when searching for a filepath containing common characters the extra
specificity of substring mode can be useful.


COMMAND MAPPINGS                                      *probe-command-mappings*

If no mappings to the probe file and buffer finder commands aren't already
defined, the following will be:

    <Leader>f  open the file finder
    <Leader>b  open the buffer finder

Adding a command like the following to vimrc can customize one of these
mappings: >

    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>f :Probe<CR>
<

PROMPT MAPPINGS                                        *probe-prompt-mappings*

Previous match           <C-p>
Next match               <C-n>

Open selected match      <Enter>
Open in split            <C-s>
Open in vsplit           <C-v>
Cancel                   <C-c> or <Esc>, if available
Refresh cache            <C-r> or <F5>

Beginning of line        <C-a>
End of line              <C-e>
Delete to end of line    <C-k>
Delete to start of line  <C-u>
Delete previous word     <C-w>
Cursor right             <C-f> or <Right>
Cursor left              <C-b> or <Left>
Delete                   <Del> or <C-d>

Up a directory           <C-y>

NOTE: If c-s doesn't work your terminal might be eating it for flow control
purposes. Consider disabling flow control (eg. stty -ixoff -ixon).

See |g:probe_mappings| for information on customizing these mappings.


COMMANDS                                                      *probe-commands*

|:Probe|                                                              *:Probe*
    Alias for |:ProbeFindFileInRepo|

|:ProbeFindFile|                                              *:ProbeFindFile*
    Open the file finder, starting in the current working directory.

|:ProbeFindFileInRepo|                                  *:ProbeFindFileInRepo*
    Open the file finder, starting in the first ancestor directory that
    contains a VCS metadirectory, or the current working directory if no
    metadirectories are found.

|:ProbeFindBuffer|                                          *:ProbeFindBuffer*
    Open the buffer finder.

|:ProbeRefresh|                                                *:ProbeRefresh*
    Delete the current cache and rescan for candidates.


OPTIONS                                                        *probe-options*

|g:probe_ignore_files|                                  *g:probe_ignore_files*
    List of vim regexes. Files matching any of them are ignored when scanning
    directory trees and thus are never searched.
    Default: (list) []

|g:probe_cache_dir|                                        *g:probe_cache_dir*
    Directory to store cached filepath lists in. If set to the empty string
    caches aren't saved to the filesystem.
    Default: (string) $HOME/.probe_cache

|g:probe_max_file_cache_size|                    *g:probe_max_file_cache_size*
    Maximum number of files to scan.
    Default: (number) 100000

|g:probe_max_height|                                      *g:probe_max_height*
    Maximum height of the match window.
    Default: (number) 10

|g:probe_reverse_sort|                                  *g:probe_reverse_sort*
    Reverse the sorting of scored matches, causing the best match to be at the
    top of the window.
    Default: (boolean) 0

|g:probe_window_location|                            *g:probe_window_location*
    Location of the match window. Possible values are |leftabove|,
    |rightbelow|, |topleft|, and |botright|, but |topleft| and |botright| seem
    like the most sensible options.
    Default: (string) "botright"

|g:probe_scoring_threshold|                        *g:probe_scoring_threshold*
    Number of matches the search must be narrowed down to before the ranking
    algorithm will be applied.
    Default: (number) 400
    
    This can be increased to give better results with shorter queries, but
    character-wise scoring is slow in VimL and responsiveness may suffer. If
    probe is stuttering while the last few characters of queries are being
    entered, try decreasing the threshold.

    The number of matches will be highlighted in the statusline until it is
    below the scoring threshold, as a warning that the query needs to be more
    specific.

|g:probe_use_wildignore|                              *g:probe_use_wildignore*
    Use 'wildignore' when scanning for files.
    Default: (boolean) 0

    g:probe_ignore_files still functions normally when this option is set.

|g:probe_mappings|                                          *g:probe_mappings*
    Dict used to customize mappings. If a mapping is given for some operation
    the default mapping will not be created.
    Default: (dict) {}

    For example, to map select_next/select_prev to <c-j>/<c-k>, put the
    following in vimrc: >

    let g:probe_mappings = {'select_next': '<c-j>', 'select_prev': '<c-k>'}
<
    To map multiple keys to an operation specify a list: >

    let g:probe_mappings = {'select_next': ['<c-j>', '<c-n>']}
<

    Available operations:

    select_next                                                 default: <c-n>
        select next match in the match window

    accept                                                    default: <enter>
        open the selected match in the current window

    accept_split                                                default: <c-s>
        open the selected match in a horizontally split window

    accept_vsplit                                               default: <c-v>
        open the selected match in a vertically split window

    refresh_cache                                         default: <c-r>, <f5>
        delete the current cache and rescan for candidates

    delete                                                      default: <c-d>
        delete the character under the cursor
        
    delete_to_start                                             default: <c-u>
        delete all characters between the cursor and the start of the line

    delete_to_end                                               default: <c-k>
        delete all characters between the cursor the end of the line

    cursor_start                                                default: <c-a>
        move the cursor to the start of the line

    up_dir                                                      default: <c-y>
        search in the parent directory (doesn't apply to all finders)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                                      *probe-acknowledgements*

Mad props to wincent for Command-T. It's a great plugin and his code is
super-clean. It was a huge help while I was figuring out how to structure
things.  Thanks to kien as well for his pure VimL fuzzy finder, ctrlp.vim,
which gave me a bunch of ideas for how to make matching and scoring responsive
without resorting to C.

Greetz fly out to Oscar and line6 for their help during design and testing.
