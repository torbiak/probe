INTRODUCTION                                                     *probe-intro*

A pure-VimL fuzzy finder inspired by kien's ctrlp.vim and wincent's Command-T.


INSTALLATION                                              *probe-installation*

1. Install Tim Pope's pathogen plugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
2. Clone or download to $HOME/.vim/bundle:

    $ git clone https://github.com/torbiak/probe.git ~/.vim/bundle/probe


USAGE                                                            *probe-usage*

probe caches the filepaths under Vim's current working directory or a VCS
repository and offers an incremental search of that cache. When the number of
matching filepaths is small enough they are ordered by a simple ranking
algorithm that favours characters matching immediately after a path separator
or another matched character, or at the beginning or end of a filepath. Because
of this ranking algorithm the best approach to finding files using probe is to
enter the first few characters of some path components as you work your way
towards your target.

Subsequence search mode:

    If the query doesn't contain any spaces, probe finds filepaths containing
    the query as a subsequence. Thus, "ulmwhat" is a reasonable query to search
    for /usr/local/man/whatis. Parts of a query can be separated by slashes to
    make them match within one path component, eg "u/l/m/what". Slashes can
    also be used to specify a minimum depth: "////what".

Substring search mode:

    If the query contains spaces, filepaths containing each space-delimited
    substring are matched. Thus, 'loc man what' is also a very specific query
    for /usr/local/man/whatis.

Subsequence mode typically results in good results in fewer keystrokes, but
when searching for a filepath containing common characters the extra
specificity of substring mode can be useful.


COMMAND MAPPINGS                                      *probe-command-mappings*

If mappings to the probe file and buffer finder commands aren't already
defined the following will be:

    <Leader>f  open the file finder
    <Leader>b  open the buffer finder

Adding a command like the following to vimrc can customize one of these
mappings: >

    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>f :Probe<CR>
<

PROMPT MAPPINGS                                        *probe-prompt-mappings*

Previous match           <C-p>
Next match               <C-n>

Open selected match      <Enter>
Open in split            <C-s>
Open in vsplit           <C-v>
Open in new tab          <C-t>
Cancel                   <C-c> or <Esc>, if available
Refresh cache            <C-r> or <F5>
Toggle persistence       <C-y>

Beginning of line        <C-a>
End of line              <C-e>
Delete to end of line    <C-k>
Delete to start of line  <C-u>
Delete previous word     <C-w>
Cursor right             <C-f> or <Right>
Cursor left              <C-b> or <Left>
Delete                   <Del> or <C-d>
History backward         <C-o>
History forward          <C-i>

NOTE: If c-s doesn't work your terminal might be eating it for flow control
purposes. Consider disabling flow control (eg. stty -ixoff -ixon).

See |g:probe_mappings| for information on customizing these mappings.

OPTIONS                                                        *probe-options*

|g:probe_ignore_files|                                  *g:probe_ignore_files*
    List of vim regexes. Files matching any of them are ignored when scanning
    directory trees and thus are never searched.
    Default: (list) []

|g:probe_cache_dir|                                        *g:probe_cache_dir*
    Directory to store cached filepath lists in. If set to the empty string
    caches aren't saved to the filesystem.
    Default: (string) $HOME/.probe_cache

|g:probe_max_file_cache_size|                    *g:probe_max_file_cache_size*
    Maximum number of files to scan.
    Default: (number) 100000

|g:probe_cache_repo_branches|                    *g:probe_cache_repo_branches*
    If true, maintain separate caches for different branches of a repository.
    Works for git and mercurial so far.
    Default: (boolean) 1

|g:probe_max_height|                                      *g:probe_max_height*
    Maximum height of the match window.
    Default: (number) 10

|g:probe_persist|                                            *g:probe_persist*
    Persist the probe window after accepting a file by default. Persistence
    can still be toggled using the binding for toggle_persistence.
    Default: (boolean) 0

|g:probe_reverse_sort|                                  *g:probe_reverse_sort*
    Reverse the sorting of scored matches, causing the best match to be at the
    top of the window.
    Default: (boolean) 0

|g:probe_sort_on_mtime|                                *g:probe_sort_on_mtime*
    Sort matches by their modification times, if they are files.
    Default: (boolean) 1

|g:probe_window_location|                            *g:probe_window_location*
    Location of the match window. Possible values are |leftabove|,
    |rightbelow|, |topleft|, and |botright|, but |topleft| and |botright| seem
    like the most sensible options.
    Default: (string) "botright"

|g:probe_scoring_threshold|                        *g:probe_scoring_threshold*
    Number of matches the search must be narrowed down to before the ranking
    algorithm will be applied.
    Default: (number) 400

    This can be increased to give better results with shorter queries, but
    character-wise scoring is slow in VimL and responsiveness may suffer. If
    probe is stuttering while the last few characters of queries are being
    entered, try decreasing the threshold.

    The number of matches will be highlighted in the statusline until it is
    below the scoring threshold, as a warning that the query needs to be more
    specific.

|g:probe_use_wildignore|                              *g:probe_use_wildignore*
    Use 'wildignore' when scanning for files.
    Default: (boolean) 0

    g:probe_ignore_files still functions normally when this option is set.

|g:probe_use_gitignore|                              *g:probe_use_gitignore*
    When in a git repository, ignore any file excluded by .gitignore (or
    other relevent exclude files) when scanning for files.
    Default: (boolean) 0

    g:probe_ignore_files and g:probe_use_wildignore still function normally
    when this option is set.

|g:probe_mappings|                                          *g:probe_mappings*
    Dict used to customize mappings. If a mapping is given for some operation
    the default mapping will not be created.
    Default: (dict) {}

    For example, to map select_next/select_prev to <c-j>/<c-k>, put the
    following in vimrc: >

    let g:probe_mappings = {'select_next': '<c-j>', 'select_prev': '<c-k>'}
<
    To map multiple keys to an operation specify a list: >

    let g:probe_mappings = {'select_next': ['<c-j>', '<c-n>']}
<

    Available operations:

    select_next                                                 default: <c-n>

    accept                                                    default: <enter>
        open the selected match in the current window

    accept_split                                                default: <c-s>
        open the selected match in a horizontally split window

    accept_vsplit                                               default: <c-v>
        open the selected match in a vertically split window

    accept_tab                                                  default: <c-t>
        open the selected match in a new tab

    refresh_cache                                         default: <c-r>, <f5>
        delete the current cache and rescan for candidates

    cancel                              default: <c-c>, <esc> (when available)
        close probe

        delete the previous word

    delete                                                      default: <c-d>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                                      *probe-acknowledgements*

Mad props to wincent for Command-T. It's a great plugin and his code is
super-clean. It was a huge help while I was figuring out how to structure
things.  Thanks to kien as well for his pure VimL fuzzy finder, ctrlp.vim,
which gave me a bunch of ideas for how to make matching and scoring responsive
without resorting to C.

Greetz fly out to Oscar and line6 for their help during design and testing, and
to Ryan and Stephane for their continued feedback.
